## Model Analysis and Real-World Examples

### 1. Fiat-Collateralized Model (Recommended)

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph ReserveSystem["Reserve Management"]
        Primary["95% AED Deposits"]
        Secondary["5% Gov Securities"]
        Monitor["Real-time Monitoring"]
    end

    subgraph Operations["Core Operations"]
        Mint["Minting"]
        Burn["Burning"]
        Transfer["Transfers"]
    end

    Primary -->|Backs| Operations
    Secondary -->|Supports| Operations
    Monitor -->|Controls| Operations

    classDef primary fill:#e1f5fe,stroke:#01579b
    class ReserveSystem,Operations primary
```

Existing Examples:
- USDC (Circle/Coinbase): Backed 1:1 by USD in regulated banks
- USDP (Paxos): Full reserve backing with monthly attestations
- XSGD (StraitsX): Singapore dollar-backed stablecoin
- EURL (Parallel): Euro-backed with French banking integration

Success Factors:
- Regular audits by major accounting firms
- Clear regulatory frameworks
- Banking partnerships
- Transparent reserve reporting

### 2. Crypto-Collateralized Model (High Risk)

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph Collateral["Collateral System"]
        Crypto["Crypto Assets"]
        Ratio["150-200% Ratio"]
        Liquidation["Liquidation Engine"]
    end

    subgraph Risks["Risk Factors"]
        Market["Market Volatility"]
        Technical["Smart Contract Risk"]
        Oracle["Price Oracle Risk"]
    end

    Crypto -->|Maintains| Ratio
    Ratio -->|Triggers| Liquidation
    Market -->|Impacts| Collateral
    Technical -->|Affects| Liquidation
    Oracle -->|Influences| Ratio

    classDef risk fill:#ffcdd2,stroke:#b71c1c
    class Collateral,Risks risk
```

Existing Examples:
- DAI (MakerDAO): Multi-collateral system with ETH, USDC backing
- sUSD (Synthetix): Collateralized by SNX tokens
- LUSD (Liquity): ETH-backed with minimum 110% collateral

Lessons Learned:
- Market crashes can trigger mass liquidations
- Oracle failures have caused system instabilities
- Complex governance decisions required
- Higher capital requirements

### 3. Hybrid Model (Medium Risk)

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph Backing["Dual Backing"]
        Fiat["Fiat Reserves"]
        Crypto["Crypto Assets"]
        Algo["Algorithms"]
    end

    subgraph Stability["Stability Mechanisms"]
        Price["Price Stability"]
        Control["Control Systems"]
        Market["Market Operations"]
    end

    Fiat -->|Primary| Price
    Crypto -->|Secondary| Price
    Algo -->|Adjusts| Control
    Control -->|Maintains| Price

    classDef hybrid fill:#fff9c4,stroke:#f57f17
    class Backing,Stability hybrid
```

Existing Examples:
- FRAX: Partial collateral with algorithmic ratio adjustment
- VAI (Venus): Multi-asset backed with algorithmic stabilization
- FEI: Protocol controlled value with direct incentives

Challenges Faced:
- Complex interaction between mechanisms
- Difficult to maintain stability in stress
- Higher operational overhead
- Regulatory uncertainty

### 4. Algorithmic Model (Very High Risk)

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph Algorithm["Algorithmic Control"]
        Supply["Supply Control"]
        Demand["Market Demand"]
        Rebase["Rebase Mechanism"]
    end

    subgraph History["Historical Issues"]
        Collapse["Price Collapses"]
        Bank["Bank Run Risk"]
        Trust["Loss of Trust"]
    end

    Supply -->|Responds to| Demand
    Demand -->|Triggers| Rebase
    Collapse -->|Causes| Bank
    Bank -->|Leads to| Trust

    classDef algo fill:#ffcdd2,stroke:#b71c1c
    class Algorithm,History algo
```

Existing Examples:
- LUNA/UST (Terra): Collapsed in May 2022
- BASIS: Never launched due to regulatory concerns
- IRON: Partially collateralized algorithmic token that failed
- EMPTY SET DOLLAR: Failed to maintain peg

Key Failures:
- Death spiral scenarios
- Bank run susceptibility
- Market manipulation vulnerability
- Loss of confidence effects
