# AED Stablecoin: Design and Implementation Framework

## Core Architecture

The AED stablecoin system consists of three integrated layers:

        Reserves["AED Reserves"]
        Monitoring["Real-time Monitoring"]

    subgraph Blockchain["Blockchain Layer"]

    end

## Stablecoin Model Analysis

### 1. Fiat-Collateralized Model (Recommended)

This model provides the most stable and regulatory-compliant approach for an AED stablecoin.

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph AuditProcess["Monthly External Audit Process"]
        Plan["Audit Planning"]
        Execute["Audit Execution"]
        Report["Audit Reporting"]
        Follow["Follow-up Actions"]
    end

    subgraph AuditScope["Required Audit Scope"]
        Reserve["Reserve Verification"]
        Smart["Smart Contract Audit"]
        Control["Control Systems"]
        Comply["Compliance Check"]
    end

    subgraph Verification["Verification Areas"]
        Balance["1:1 Reserve Ratio"]
        Trans["Transaction Records"]
        Risk["Risk Controls"]
        Tech["Technical Systems"]
    end

    subgraph Reports["Required Reports"]
        CBUAE["CBUAE Report"]
        Public["Public Attestation"]
        Board["Board Report"]
        Action["Action Items"]
    end

    Plan -->|Defines| AuditScope
    Execute -->|Covers| Verification
    Report -->|Produces| Reports
    Follow -->|Updates| Action

    Reserve -->|Checks| Balance
    Smart -->|Reviews| Tech
    Control -->|Assesses| Risk
    Comply -->|Validates| Trans

    Balance -->|Confirms| CBUAE
    Risk -->|Informs| Board
    Tech -->|Details in| Action
    Trans -->|Supports| Public

```

Key Implementation Features:
- 100% AED backing in UAE banks
- Multiple banking partnerships
- Independent monitoring
- Monthly attestations
- Public reserve reporting
- Regular security audits

Successful Implementation Examples:

1. USDC (Circle/Coinbase):
   - Maintains 100% reserves in cash and short-term US Treasury bonds
   - Monthly attestations by Grant Thornton
   - Real-world usage: Powers major DeFi protocols like Aave and Compound
   - Daily volume: Over $5 billion
   - Key lesson: Transparency builds trust

2. EUROC (Circle):
   - Euro-backed stablecoin launched in 2022
   - Fully backed by euros in European financial institutions
   - Demonstrates successful regional implementation
   - Key lesson: Regional banking relationships are crucial

3. XSGD (StraitsX):
   - Singapore dollar-backed stablecoin
   - Licensed by Monetary Authority of Singapore
   - Regional success story in regulatory compliance
   - Key lesson: Working with regulators early enables growth

Operational Example:
When a user wants to mint 100,000 AED tokens:
1. User deposits 100,000 AED to designated bank account
2. Bank confirms receipt through API
3. Smart contract mints equivalent tokens
4. Regular audit confirms matching of tokens to reserves

# Alternative Stablecoin Models (Not Recommended)

## 1. Crypto-Collateralized Model

This model relies on cryptocurrency collateral, typically requiring significant over-collateralization to account for market volatility.

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph Collateral["Collateral Management"]
        Deposit["Crypto Deposits (ETH/BTC)"]
        Ratio["Collateral Ratio 150-200%"]
        Vault["Collateral Vault"]
        Price["Price Oracles"]
    end

    subgraph Mechanisms["Stability Mechanisms"]
        Monitor["Position Monitor"]
        Liquidate["Liquidation Engine"]
        Auction["Auction System"]
    end

    subgraph Risks["Risk Factors"]
        Market["Market Crashes"]
        Oracle["Oracle Failures"]
        Network["Network Congestion"]
        Smart["Smart Contract Bugs"]
    end

    Deposit -->|Locks into| Vault
    Vault -->|Monitored by| Monitor
    Price -->|Updates| Monitor
    Monitor -->|Triggers| Liquidate
    Liquidate -->|Executes| Auction

    Market -->|Impacts| Vault
    Oracle -->|Affects| Monitor
    Network -->|Delays| Liquidate
    Smart -->|Compromises| Vault

    classDef process fill:#e1f5fe,stroke:#01579b
    class Risks critical
    class Mechanisms warning
    class Collateral process
```

Example Case Study - DAI's March 2020 Crisis:
When ETH crashed 50% in 24 hours, the system experienced:
- $8.32 million forced liquidations
- Network congestion preventing timely liquidations
- Zero-bid liquidation auctions
- Required emergency governance interventions

## 2. Algorithmic Model

This model attempts to maintain price stability through automated supply adjustments, but has proven highly unstable in practice.

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph Algorithm["Price Stability Algorithm"]
        Target["Price Target ($1)"]
        Supply["Token Supply"]
        Demand["Market Demand"]
        Rebase["Rebase Mechanism"]
    end

    subgraph Spiral["Death Spiral Mechanism"]
        Loss["Price Drop"]
        Panic["User Panic"]
        Sell["Mass Selling"]
        Drop["Further Price Drop"]
    end

    subgraph Market["Market Operations"]
        Trade["Trading Activity"]
        Arb["Arbitrage"]
        Bond["Bonding Curve"]
    end

    Supply -->|Adjusts to| Target
    Demand -->|Influences| Trade
    Trade -->|Affects| Target
    Rebase -->|Modifies| Supply
    Bond -->|Controls| Trade

    Loss -->|Triggers| Panic
    Panic -->|Causes| Sell
    Sell -->|Creates| Drop
    Drop -->|Amplifies| Loss

    classDef algo fill:#e1f5fe,stroke:#01579b
    classDef danger fill:#ffcdd2,stroke:#b71c1c
    classDef market fill:#fff3cd,stroke:#856404
    class Algorithm algo
    class Spiral danger
    class Market market
```

Example Case Study - Terra/LUNA Collapse (May 2022):
- Started with minor price deviation from $1
- Arbitrage mechanism failed to restore peg
- Death spiral activated: UST depeg → LUNA inflation → further UST depeg
- Resulted in complete system collapse within 72 hours
- $40 billion in value destroyed

## 3. Hybrid Model Risks

Hybrid models attempt to combine multiple stability mechanisms but often inherit the weaknesses of each approach.

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph Components["Hybrid Components"]
        Fiat["Partial Fiat Backing"]
        Crypto["Crypto Collateral"]
        Algo["Algorithmic Element"]
    end

    subgraph Interactions["System Interactions"]
        Ratio["Backing Ratio"]
        Stab["Stability Module"]
        Control["Control System"]
    end

    subgraph Failures["Failure Modes"]
        Bank["Bank Run"]
        Crash["Collateral Crash"]
        Bug["Algorithm Failure"]
        Combined["Cascading Failure"]
    end

    Fiat -->|Partially backs| Ratio
    Crypto -->|Supplements| Ratio
    Algo -->|Adjusts| Control
    Control -->|Maintains| Ratio

    Bank -->|Triggers| Combined
    Crash -->|Amplifies| Combined
    Bug -->|Compounds| Combined

    classDef hybrid fill:#e1f5fe,stroke:#01579b
    classDef interact fill:#fff3cd,stroke:#856404
    classDef fail fill:#ffcdd2,stroke:#b71c1c
    class Components hybrid
    class Interactions interact
    class Failures fail
```

Key Historical Failures:
- Iron Finance (IRON/TITAN): Partial collateral model that collapsed in June 2021
- Basis Cash: Attempted algorithmic stability, failed to maintain peg
- Empty Set Dollar: Complex hybrid model that ultimately failed
